Accordingly, a Staking order can be recorded in DFX's system and the corresponding transfer can be made by bank transfer or by any other means of payment available in the DFX app. As soon as the amounts intended for Staking are available in the cryptocurrency required for Staking, they are to be transferred by the Customer, or in case of a previous currency exchange by DFX, to a wallet of DFX intended for Staking. For the operation of a node on the DeFiChain, at least CHF 50,000 is required. This is then the minimum amount needed to run the Stake. In order to provide access to the Staking to all customers, the cryptocurrencies intended for Staking are held in the pool by several customers on a wallet of DFX. Once the minimum amount required for Staking is available on DFX's pooled wallet, DFX will execute the Stake on its own behalf but for the account of the customers. Staking may commence within 8 hours after DFX has reached the minimum amount. Immediately after completion of the Staking, DFX will transfer the Customer Assets back to the Customers' Wallets, to which DFX has no access. Alternatively, DFX will exchange the cryptocurrencies back into CHF, EUR or USD upon instruction of the customer prior to payout. In the latter case, the terms and conditions for the sale of cryptocurrencies apply. The customer assets are held in the DFX wallet designated for staking for a maximum of 60 days. The settlement period between the termination of the staking and the deblocking of the DFI tokens in the DFX Wallet is 16 hours. Only after the expiration of these 16 hours, DFX can transfer the assets back to the respective customer wallets. A customer can terminate the staking of its crypto assets via the DFX system by giving 24 hours' notice at the end of each month. The first possible termination date is March 31, 2022. DFX points out that a maximum staking volume of 100,000 EUR or 100,000 CHF can be settled per day and per customer. Exceptions may be considered and will be discussed on an individual basis. Staking rewards will be credited by DeFiChain to the pooled DFX wallet respectively. DFX distributes staking rewards to customers on a daily basis.

DFX has no influence on how the DeFi market will be regulated in the future and what consequences the use of DeFi protocols may have for users in the future. DFX cannot guarantee that it will continue to operate the Service at all times and DFX cannot guarantee that it will take back any Coins sold if the regulatory environment changes.
