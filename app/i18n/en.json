Accordingly, a Staking order can be recorded in DFX's system and the associated transfer can be made by bank transfer or any other means of payment available in DFX's app. As soon as the amounts intended for the operation of the Staking Node are available in the cryptocurrency required for Staking, they are to be transferred by the Customer, or in the case of a preceding currency exchange by DFX, to a wallet of DFX intended for Staking. With the operation of a staking node, transactions and other operations of the respective blockchain protocol are validated. For this activity, the operators of the staking node may receive rewards ('Staking Rewards') according to the rules of the respective underlying Blockchain protocol. A minimum of CHF 50,000 is required to operate a node on the DeFiChain. This is then the minimum amount which is required to run the Stake. In order to provide access to the Staking to all customers, the cryptocurrencies intended for Staking are held in the pool by several customers on a wallet of DFX. Once the minimum amount required for Staking is available on DFX's pooled wallet, DFX will execute the Stake on its own behalf but for the account of the customers. Staking may commence within 8 hours after DFX has reached the minimum amount. Immediately after completion of the Staking, DFX will transfer the Customer Assets back to the Customers' Wallets, to which DFX has no access. Alternatively, DFX will exchange the cryptocurrencies back into CHF, EUR or USD upon instruction of the customer prior to payout. In the latter case, the terms and conditions for the sale of cryptocurrencies apply. The customer assets will be in DFX's wallet designated for staking for a maximum of 60 58 days. The settlement period between the termination of the staking and the deblocking of the DFI tokens in DFX's Wallet is 16 hours. Only after the expiration of these 16 hours, DFX can transfer the assets back to the respective customer wallets. A customer can terminate the staking of its crypto assets via the DFX system by giving 24 hours' notice at the end of each month. The first possible termination date is March 31, 2022. DFX notes that a maximum staking volume of 100,000 EUR or 100,000 CHF can be processed per day and per customer. Exceptions may be considered and will be discussed on an individual basis. The Staking Rewards will be credited by DeFiChain to the pooled DFX Wallet each time as a result of the operation of the Staking Node. DFX will transfer the Staking Rewards due to the customer to the customer's non-custodial wallet on a daily basis."

Percentages are calculated on actual transaction volume. The transaction volume figures are in EUR in the tables below.

This means that the referral program is only valid up to a total referral bonus of CHF 500 per customer: CHF 100000 * 0.5% = CHF 500. If the purchase volume of a customer exceeds CHF 100,000, which has been processed through this referral link, no more bonus will be paid. However, the number of customers acquired through referral links is unlimited. DFX reserves the right to change or terminate the referral program at any time without giving reasons.

Decentralized Finance is a novel construct where it is not yet fully clear what the legal and regulatory implications will be for users and businesses in this business area. DFX always complies with the current Swiss law and is in constant exchange with the authorities to implement this. DFX reserves the right to suspend trading of individual cryptocurrencies at any time or to add additional cryptocurrencies or products to its offering. Customers of the DFX Brokerage Service are not entitled to trade cryptocurrencies if they have previously been suspended from trading. This also applies if these cryptocurrencies have previously been purchased through the DFX Brokerage Service. Furthermore, cryptocurrencies that originate from the Decentralized Finance construct, e.g. by trading on a Decentralized Exchange (DEX) or by an exchange through an Atomic Swap, may be declared as Coins with increased risk and may be treated differently in the future than Coins that have not been in such DeFi protocols. DFX has no influence on how the DeFi market will be regulated in the future and what consequences the use of DeFi protocols may have for users in the future. DFX cannot guarantee to continue operating the service at all times, nor can DFX guarantee to take back sold coins if the regulatory environment changes. This also applies to cryptocurrencies used for staking. The staked cryptocurrencies basically experience the same fate as the cryptocurrencies used for this purpose per se."
